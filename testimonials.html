                            <p>I was working with Saurin Parikh and Haresh Umaretiya for few years.  Saurin and Haresh are very sound electrical engineers. I truly value the significant contributions each one of them has made to DC Water through the design and construction services for several major, multi-million-dollar projects.  I have known both of them very well and have closely interacted with them on projects to be able to confidently vouch for their deep knowledge of power distribution products and systems. Their ability to step beyond the paper and get involved in actual installation/commissioning activities in the field is an asset for any project. Pleasing personalities and excellent members to have on any project team. I have no doubts that they will meet with resounding success in all of their endeavors.  My best wishes to Haresh and Saurin for their new venture, Astute Engineering, LLC.</p>

I admire his knowledge of electrical power distribution equipment, Instrumentation & Controls and good understanding of our systems. He is punctual, persuasive and maintains a positive attitude. I acknowledge his valuable contributions during design and construction period. He demonstrated high skills, experience and thoroughness by identifying and correcting significant deficiencies during factory and field testing of each of the major pieces of equipment. He is intelligent, diligent and hardworking professional.  He is a great team player and very pleasant to work with. I wish Haresh all the very best in his new venture, Astute Engineering, LLC.</p>
